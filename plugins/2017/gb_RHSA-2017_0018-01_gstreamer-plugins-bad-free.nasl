Security Fix(es):

  * An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in GStreamer's VMware VMnc video file format decoding plug-in. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to cause an application using GStreamer
to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application. (CVE-2016-9445)

  * A memory corruption flaw was found in GStreamer's Nintendo NSF music file
format decoding plug-in. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause an
application using GStreamer to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the application.
(CVE-2016-9447)

  * An out-of-bounds heap read flaw was found in GStreamer's H.264 parser. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to cause an application using GStreamer
to crash. (CVE-2016-9809)

Note: This update removes the vulnerable Nintendo NSF plug-in.");
